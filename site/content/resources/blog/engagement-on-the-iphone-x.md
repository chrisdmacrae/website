Despite its $1,000+ price tag, Apple’s iPhone X is flying off the shelves. From the moment it launched, Apple sold close to [3 million iPhone X devices in just 20 minutes](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3236414/apple-ios/this-is-why-iphone-x-is-apples-most-important-product.html), 2,500 units per second. With iPhone X devices flooding the market, we wanted to understand how the users of these devices are behaving and what this means for advertisers. 

Our more than 300 billion data points collected monthly, combined with our ability to discern specific device models, provided more than enough information from which to glean insights. We asked ourselves, “Are iPhone X users engaging more or less with ads, compared to users on older iPhone models?” Higher engagement might suggest that these early adopters are engrossed in all things mobile, including ad experiences. Less engagement might mean their technological savvy is encouraging them to consume content efficiently and only glance at, not engage with, most ads. 

After analyzing millions of mobile ad impressions over the one-month period in which the iPhone X was available (November 3, 2017 - December 3, 2017), the results were clear—**ad engagement is highest on iPhone X compared to all previous iPhone models** and is more than double that of the iPhone 5.

This engagement insight offers two explanations. First, the early adopters of the iPhone X are truly power users and are that much more engrossed in their mobile content and ads. Additionally, there is a physical reality that must be considered—the iPhone X’s key feature is an edge-to-edge screen that is 5.8” (bigger than even the iPhone 8 Plus). With more vertical space, users are likely scrolling more frequently and actively.

Marketers that want to reach these highly technologically-savvy iPhone X customers should use this higher level of engagement to their advantage. One way is with ad formats that animate as the user scrolls. Yieldmo’s [Hyperscroller](https://formats.yieldmo.com/#/format/hyperplay) is one example of this type of format that will ensure the ad experience is just as engaging as their shiny new device.
