Hello again from the Yieldmo A|B Testing Lab!

We just love how much brand marketers like our [Pull](http://formatsoldsite.yieldmo.com/#/demo/pull) format (GIF below) and how they’ve built creative specifically for the unit to truly take advantage of its sequential storytelling possibilities. 

![Pull J.Crew Example](http://oldsite.yieldmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Pull_Meatball_Post_Mar2017.gif =396x509)

With the increase in the number of campaigns utilizing the Pull format, the A|B Testing Lab decided to start experimenting to see if we could improve performance even more. And that’s when we thought about meatballs (being close to lunchtime may have helped too…).

 

### **“What do ‘meatballs’ have to do with mobile ads?” you ask**

With the challenge to increase the engagement of the Pull unit, our Format Design team launched an exploration into which mobile UI icons and symbols would be most intuitive, and thus most widely adopted by users.

With its small screen, mobile designers have relied on a number of icons to enhance the user experience—and it just so happens that many of them are named after foods! This trend all started with the menu icon, which neatly conceals information until a user is ready to expand and explore. Within the design community, these three stacked horizontal lines began to be called a “hamburger” (note: some designers have alternative names like “drawer menu”). As mobile design became more sophisticated, more and more icons were introduced like the “bento menu” (also known as the “waffle menu”), and yes, even “meatballs.”
