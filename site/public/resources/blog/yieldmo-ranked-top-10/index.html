  <h3 class="headline-cap title">Yieldmo Ranked in the Top 10% of Fastest Growing North American Companies on Deloitte’s 2017 Technology Fast 500™</h3>

  <p>Yieldmo ranked number 45 on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500™, the 500 fastest growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and energy tech companies in North America. Yieldmo grew <strong>3,657%</strong> between 2013 and 2016.</p>

<p>Yieldmo’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Yavonditte credits this extraordinary growth to Yieldmo’s highly-engaging, customer-centric approach to advertising. Driven by the world’s only engagement analytics system, Yieldmo delivers its customers deep insights derived from proprietary, user-preferred ad formats. Yieldmo analyzes more than 250 billion data points each month to reveal the truth behind advertisers’ campaign performance.</p>

<p>Yavonditte said, “Yieldmo’s engagement data goes beyond the views and clicks to give marketers a deep understanding of how successfully their campaigns connected with target customers. This powerful information translates into higher performance, improved return on ad spend, and many new and repeat customers.”</p>

<p>Yieldmo also offers marketers placement within its premium mobile marketplace, the fifth largest in the U.S. overall behind Google, Facebook, Amazon and Yahoo (verified by comScore). This marketplace can be accessed through both Yieldmo’s high-touch managed service and programmatically through the leading DSPs.</p>

<p>“The Deloitte 2017 North America Technology Fast 500 winners underscore the impact of technological innovation and world class customer service in driving growth, in a fiercely competitive environment,” said Sandra Shirai, vice chairman, Deloitte Consulting LLP and U.S. technology, media and telecommunications leader. “These companies are on the cutting edge and are transforming the way we do business. We extend our sincere congratulations to all the winners for achieving remarkable growth while delivering new services and experiences for their customers.”</p>

<p>“Emerging growth companies are powering innovation in the broader economy. The growth rates delivered by the companies on this year’s North America Technology Fast 500 ranking are a bright spot for the capital markets and a strong indicator that the emerging growth technology sector will continue to deliver a strong return on investment,” said Heather Gates, national managing director of Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP’s emerging growth company practice. “Deloitte is dedicated to supporting the best and brightest companies of the future in the emerging growth company sector. We are proud to acknowledge the significant accomplishments of this year’s Fast 500 winners.”</p>
