  <h3>/work/single.html | the &#34;Rapt&#34; Demo </h3>
  <p>We want to give sales people a visual, mobile way to show that we capture a lot of human interactions before the click, and show the potential to tie that data to insights and more elemental advertiser goals (like brand lift). The demo needs to be conducive to an advertiser client looking at it on their own phone during Cannes social events (Yieldmo Yacht, etc.), and needs to be reliable in low connection speed environments.</p>
